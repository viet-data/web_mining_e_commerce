This project presents a novel dataset and a hybrid framework for product retrieval on e-commerce platforms. The dataset consists of products and queries in Vietnamese, labeled by combining automated and manual methods. The hybrid framework combines bi-encoder, cross-encoder, and BM25 models to enhance the retrieval accuracy and relevance. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms individual models and achieves stable performance across various metrics. However, compared with other combining methods, there is no best model, suggesting the unstable of retrieval systems. The paper also discusses the challenges and limitations of the current methods and suggests directions for future research
